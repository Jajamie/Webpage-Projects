    <h1>What does a prostate do for a man?</h1>
    <img src="image/vas deferens.jpg" alt="vas deferens">
    <p>Your prostate contributes additional fluid to your semen (ejaculate). Ejaculate is a whitish-gray fluid that releases from your penis when you orgasm. The fluid contains enzymes, zinc and citric acid, which help nourish sperm cells and lubricate your urethra (pronounced “yer-ree-thruh”). The urethra is a tube through which ejaculate and pee flow out of your body.</p>

    <p>Your prostate’s muscles also help push semen into and through your urethra when you orgasm.</p>

    <h2>Where is the prostate located?</h2>
    <p>Your prostate is below your bladder and in front of your rectum. Your urethra runs through the center of your prostate.</p>

    <h2>What does the prostate look like?</h2>
    <p>Your prostate has five lobes: anterior (in the front) and posterior (in the back) lobes, two lateral lobes (on the sides) and one median (in the middle) lobe. Connective tissues and glandular tissues make up its structure. The prostatic fascia covers your prostate. Prostatic fascia is a sheet of stretchy connective tissue.</p>

    <h2>How big is the prostate?</h2>
    <p>Your prostate is about the size of a walnut.</p>

    <p>The prostate usually gets larger after age 40 (benign prostatic hyperplasia). It can grow from the size of a walnut to the size of a lemon. Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) isn’t cancerous, and it doesn’t increase your risk of developing prostate cancer.</p>

    <h2>How much does your prostate weigh?</h2>
    <p>Your prostate weighs about 1 ounce (30 grams), which is as heavy as five U.S. quarters.</p>
