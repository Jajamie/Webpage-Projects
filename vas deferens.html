    <h1>What is the vas deferens?</h1>
    <img src="image/vas deferens.jpg" alt="vas deferens">
    <p class="about">Your two vasa deferentia (plural) are part of the male reproductive system. The vas deferens (singular) is also called a ductus deferens or a sperm duct. This long muscular tube runs from the epididymis into the pelvic cavity behind your bladder and connects to your urethra through a structure called the ejaculatory duct. Your vas deferens is surrounded by your spermatic cord and transports mature sperm to the urethra before you ejaculate.</p>

    <h2>What does the vas deferens do?</h2>
    <p>Your testes are the place where sperm cells are created. From there, the sperm moves into the epididymis, which is a structure located on top of the testicle. The epididymis stores sperm cells and has the job of bringing them to maturity so they’re able to fertilize eggs.</p>

    <p>When you’re sexually aroused, muscle contractions move the sperm from the epididymis to the vas deferens and from there into the urethra so you’re able to ejaculate semen outside of your body. During the process, your body adds secretions to the sperm cells to make semen.</p>

    <h2>How long is the vas deferens?</h2>
    <p>The vas deferens, or ductus deferens, can be 30 centimeters (almost 12 inches) to 45 centimeters (almost 18 inches) long. Some parts of it are coiled, but other parts are straight. The tube is described as being fibromuscular, meaning that it’s made of fibrous tissue and muscle tissue.</p>
