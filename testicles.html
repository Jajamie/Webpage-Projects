    <h1>What is a testicle?</h1>
    <img src="image/testicles.jpg" alt="testicles">
    <p>A testicle (pronounced “teh-stuh-kl”) is part of the anatomy of men and people assigned male at birth (AMAB). Generally, you’ll have two testicles. These body parts make sperm and hormones.</p> 
    <p>Other names for your testicles are male gonads or testes (pronounced “teh-steez”). One testicle is called a testis. There are other more casual names for testicles that you might hear or even use yourself, including “balls,” “nuts” and “cojones.”</p>

    <h2>What do the testicles do?</h2>
    <p>The testicles make sperm and sex hormones, particularly testosterone.</p>

    <h2>How do the testicles make sperm?</h2>
    <p>Testicles are about two degrees Celsius lower in temperature than the rest of your body. Cooler temperatures are better for making sperm, a process called spermatogenesis. In each of the testes, the process happens in tubes called seminiferous tubules. There are a surprising number of tubes in each testis — about 700.</p>

    <p>It takes about 74 days for sperm cells to mature. The immature cells get the blood and nutrients they need in the tubules. From there, they’re pushed along to the epididymis, another type of tube that runs along the back side of your testicle. The epididymis connects to the vas deferens, which is the tube that lets sperm leave your body through your penis.</p>

    <h2>What are the hormones made by the testes?</h2>
    <p>The testes make hormones like testosterone in the Leydig cells. Testosterone is a hormone that causes people to have deeper voices, stronger muscles and body hair. The testes also make these other hormones:</p>

    <ul> 
        <li><strong>Inhibin B:</strong> Serum levels of this protein are related to testicular volume and sperm counts in adults.</li>
        <li><strong>Anti-Mullerian hormone:</strong> This hormone is important to the development of internal male reproductive organs.</li>
        <li><strong>Insulin-like factor 3:</strong> This hormone helps testicles descend into the scrotum from the abdomen and to continue to develop in the scrotum.</li>
        <li><strong>Estradiol:</strong> This hormone is important in making sperm.</li>
    </ul>
