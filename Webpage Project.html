  <h1>Male Reproductive System</h1>
  <p class="about"> The male reproductive system includes the external genitals (the penis, testes and the scrotum) and internal parts, including the prostate gland, vas deferens and urethra.</p> <br>
  <p class="about"> Your fertility and sexual traits depend on the normal functioning of your reproductive system, as well as hormones released from the brain.</p>

        <img src="image/male reproductive system.jpg" alt="male reproductive system">
        <p>The male reproductive system includes a group of organs that make up the reproductive system and urinary system in men and people assigned male at birth (AMAB). </p>

        <p>The male reproductive system contains internal and external parts. Internal parts are inside your body, and external parts are outside your body. Together, these organs help you urinate (pee), have sexual intercourse and make biological children.</p>

        <p>The male reproductive system includes parts of the male body that are involved in sexual activity, fertility, and reproduction. It includes both the external genital such as the penis and testes, as well as the internal parts such as the prostate gland and urethra.  </p>
      </div>

      <h2 id="male external">What are the external parts of the male reproductive system?</h2>
      <p>Most of the male reproductive system is on the outside of your abdominal cavity or pelvis. The external body parts of the male reproductive system include the penis, scrotum and testicles. Another name for these parts is genitals or genitalia.</p>

      <ul class="list">
        <li> <strong> <a href="penis.html" target="_blank">Penis.</a></strong> The penis contains tissue that fills with blood during sexual arousal, making the penis erect (or ‘hard’). Semen is a mixture of sperm and fluid from the male reproductive organs. It exits the penis, through the urethra, during ejaculation.</li> <br>

        <li><strong><a href="scrotum.html" target="_blank"> Scrotum.</a></strong> The scrotum protects your testicles and provides a sort of “climate-control system.” For normal sperm development, the testes must be at a temperature that’s slightly cooler than body temperature (between 97 and 99 degrees Fahrenheit or 36 and 37 degrees Celsius). Special muscles in the wall of the scrotum let it contract (tighten) and relax. Your scrotum contracts to move your testicles closer to your body for warmth and protection. It relaxes away from your body to cool them.</li> <br>

        <li><strong><a href="testicles.html" target="_blank">Testicles.(testes)</a> </strong> The testes are oval-shaped organs that lie in your scrotum. They’re about the size of two large olives. The spermatic cord holds the testicles in place and supplies them with blood. Most people AMAB have two testicles, on the left and right side of the scrotum. The testicles make testosterone and produce sperm. Within the testicles are coiled masses of tubes. These are the seminiferous tubules. The seminiferous tubules produce sperm cells through spermatogenesis.</li> <br>

        <li><strong>Epididymis.</strong> The epididymis is a long, coiled tube that rests on the back of each testicle. It carries and stores the sperm cells that your testicles create. The epididymis also brings the sperm to maturity — the sperm that emerge from the testicles are immature and incapable of fertilization. During sexual arousal, muscle contractions force the sperm into the vas deferens.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 id="male internal">What are the internal parts of the male reproductive system?</h2>
      <p>There are several internal (accessory) organs in the male reproductive system. They include:</p>

      <ul class="list">
      <li> <strong><a href="vas deferens.html" target="_blank">Vas deferens.</a></strong> The vas deferens is a long, muscular tube that travels from the epididymis into the pelvic cavity, just behind the urinary bladder. The vas deferens transports mature sperm to the urethra in preparation for ejaculation.</li> <br>

      <li><strong>Ejaculatory ducts. </strong> Each testicle has a vas deferens that joins with seminal vesicle ducts to form ejaculatory ducts. The ejaculatory ducts move through your prostate, where they collect fluid to add to semen. They empty into your urethra.</li> <br>

      <li><strong>Urethra. </strong> The urethra is the tube that carries pee from your bladder outside of your body. If you have a penis, it also ejaculates semen when you reach orgasm.</li> <br>

      <li><strong>Seminal vesicles.</strong> The seminal vesicles are sac-like pouches that attach to the vas deferens near the base of the bladder. Seminal vesicles make up to 80% of your ejaculatory fluid, including fructose. Fructose is an energy source for sperm and helps them move (motility).</li> <br>

      <li> <strong><a href="vas deferens.html" target="_blank">Prostate gland.</a></strong> The prostate gland is a walnut-sized gland that rests below your bladder, in front of your rectum. The prostate adds additional fluid to ejaculate, which helps nourish sperm. The urethra runs through the center of the prostate gland.</li> <br>

      <li><strong>Bulbourethral (Cowper) glands. </strong> The bulbourethral glands are pea-sized structures on the sides of your urethra, just below your prostate. They create a clear, slippery fluid that empties directly into the urethra. This fluid lubricates the urethra and neutralizes any acids that may remain from your pee.</li>
      </ul>
